    "text": "1 Introduction\nAs a biomedical engineer who has been involved in a variety of research labs, I am interested in understanding the reasons as to why different clinical trials make it to various stages and/or to completion.\nCancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driving a continuous demand for effective therapeutic development. Clinical trials play a critical role in translating scientific discoveries into approved treatments, yet the majority of cancer trials fail to progress through all phases of development to become a therapeutic use. Understanding the factors that contribute to trial success or failure is essential for improving study design, resource allocation, and patient outcomes.\nThrough exploratory data analysis and data visualization using publicly available clinical trials data, this project seeks to provide insight into what differentiates successful cancer clinical trials from those that end in termination. These findings can inform future trial design and highlight structural advantages or challenges within oncology research that contribute to high attrition rates across clinical phases.",

    "text": "The data used in this analysis is all received from clinicaltrials.gov. This data is publically available and all known clinical trials must be registered through this website, thus it contains all of the clinical trials being conducted and that have been conducted. Given that there are large amounts of data, the data that is used in this project is cutoff to the top trials in the sets. While this dataset is comprehensive, the inputs are done by the principle investigators (PI) doing the research, and thus there are inconsistencies across inputs in the data. For example, the types of cancer cannot be used because they are each listed differently according to how the PI labels the cancer.\n\n\nCode\n## Description\n\n\n## Missing value analysis",

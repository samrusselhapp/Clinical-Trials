    "text": "1 Introduction\nCancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driving a continuous demand for effective therapeutic development. Clinical trials play a critical role in translating scientific discoveries into approved treatments, yet many cancer trials fail to progress through all phases of development to become a therapeutic use.\nAs a biomedical engineer who has been involved in a variety of research labs, I often think about the various factors that are attributed to research and clinical trials. Where are the majority of oncology trials located, what happens at each phase of the trial, and which trials are the most successful?\nThis project seeks to provide insight into what differentiates successful cancer clinical trials from those that end in termination. These findings can inform future trial design and highlight structural advantages or challenges within oncology research that contribute to high attribution rates across clinical phases. Understanding where trials are geographically concentrated also offers value, as location influences patient access to studies and helps identify where funding, resources, and outreach may be most effectively allocated.",

While this data set is comprehensive, the inputs are done by the principle investigators (PI) doing the research, and thus there are inconsistencies across inputs in the data.

Often missing values in cities/regions is attributed to the trial being outside of the US and thus it could not be classified as a US state resulting in a NA.",

This proves that while the general geographical trends of where cancer trials remain consistent, there may be some states that have a greater presence of specific cancer specializations.",

This is also where they determine the ideal dosage at which the therapeutic can be administered.\nPhase 2 (Efficacy) - Slightly larger groups of humans are tested to see if the intervention works and to monitor the side effects.\nPhase 3 (Comparison) - Using even larger groups than seen in phase 2, the intervention is compared to other current and similar interventions on the market. This is to compare the treatment to the standard and monitor the long-term side effects. After the completion of phase 3, the product can be FDA approved.\nPhase 4 (Post-Marketing) - Following FDA approval, the intervention is assessed long term for further side effects and efficacy while it is on the market. It can also be studied for new potential uses of the product.\nPatient enrollment patterns across clinical trial phases can be assessed by examining the top 1,000 trials and their respective enrollment numbers.\n\n\nCode\nTop_1000$Enrollment &lt;- as.numeric(Top_1000$Enrollment)\n\nTop_1000 &lt;- Top_1000 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Phase_Rank = case_when(\n      Phases == \"PHASE1\" ~ 1,\n      Phases == \"PHASE2\" ~ 2,\n      Phases == \"PHASE3\" ~ 3,\n      Phases == \"PHASE4\" ~ 4,\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_\n    )\n  )\navg_enrollment &lt;- Top_1000 |&gt;\n  group_by(Phase_Rank) |&gt;\n  summarise(Avg_Enrollment = mean(Enrollment, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(avg_enrollment, aes(x = Phase_Rank, y = Avg_Enrollment)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"cornflowerblue\") + \n  labs(title = \"Average Enrollment by Trial Phase\",\n       x = \"Trial Phase\",\n       y = \"Average Enrollment of Participants\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that phase 3 has the largest number of patients enrolled in the trials, which is expected given that it is the final phase before FDA approval and often has hundreds to thousands of patients enrolled. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials often have a much greater filter of patients that can be recruited and qualify for the studies, resulting in lower enrollment numbers (below 100). Phase 3 and Phase 4 studies are designed to be broader and more representative of real-world populations, allowing for more flexible inclusion criteria and therefore much higher enrollment.",

Completion indicates that the trial ran as expected, although does not necessarily guarantee that it will make it to approval.

It is surprising that stage 4, the stage following clinical trial used primarily as surveillance, has a termination rate similar to phase 3. One might expect it to be closer to zero since it has gone through all three stages and already hit the market, so termination should be less likely.\nTo understand how the enrollments and phase direct the outcome of the trials, the completion status compared with phase and enrollment numbers.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(Top_1000 |&gt; filter(!is.na(Study.Status)), aes(x = Phase_Rank, y = Enrollment)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Enrollment, color = Study.Status), alpha = 0.6) + \n  geom_jitter(aes(color = Study.Status), width = 0.3, height = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Completed\" = \"forestgreen\", \"Terminated\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n                      labels = c(\"Phase 1\", \"Phase 2\", \"Phase 3\", \"Phase 4\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Trial Enrollment by Phase and Status\",\n        x = \"Trial Phase\",\n        y = \"Patient Enrollment\",\n        size = \"Patient Enrollment\",\n        color = \"Study Status\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the higher the patient enrollment, the more likely the trial is to result in completion. As noted earlier, the higher phases have more patient enrollment and we can see they also result in greater success. Thus we can conclude that trials that have more patients are more likely to go to completion and those with fewer patients (approaching zero) have a much greater failure rate. (Note: Jittering is used slightly for height to show greater distribution patterns, although minimally to not skew the y axis enrollment values)",

The failure to success ratio of drugs and biological products is comparable, as roughly 2/3 of each are completed and the other 1/3 are terminated. Thus, the completion of a status is seeminly independent of the intervention used.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The findings from this data concluded that the distribution of trials is primarily located in larger states where the most amount of medical institutions lie. As well, the most successful trials are the trials with the most amount of patients enrolled and they are the most likely to end in completion. As for each phase of clinical trials, the majority of failure happens in the first two phases and successes are more likely later in the process. The most common form of intervention are drugs with biological products following, although they are almost equally as likely to fail vs. succeed.\nThese indications are critical for physicians to be able to provide their patients access to these trials in locations where the trial they are in need of is primarily located. It is helpful for researchers to know where the bottleneck of the clinical trial process lies, and some of the ways to improve completion outcomes (such as increasing enrollment). In the future, it would be beneficial to look at how each cancer type compares across phases and interventions to understand if there are some cancer types or diseases in general that are better or worse in clinical trials.",

# Introduction

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driving a continuous demand for effective therapeutic development. Clinical trials play a critical role in translating scientific discoveries into approved treatments, yet many cancer trials fail to progress through all phases of development to become a therapeutic use.

As a biomedical engineer who has been involved in a variety of research labs, I often think about the various factors that are attributed to research and clinical trials. Where are the majority of oncology trials located, what happens at each phase of the trial, and which trials are the most successful?

This project seeks to provide insight into what differentiates successful cancer clinical trials from those that end in termination. These findings can inform future trial design and highlight structural advantages or challenges within oncology research that contribute to high attribution rates across clinical phases. Understanding where trials are geographically concentrated also offers value, as location influences patient access to studies and helps identify where funding, resources, and outreach may be most effectively allocated.

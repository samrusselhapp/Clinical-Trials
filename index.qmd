# Introduction

As a biomedical engineer who has been involved in a variety of research labs, I am interested in understanding the reasons as to why different clinical trials make it to various stages and/or to completion. 

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driving a continuous demand for effective therapeutic development. Clinical trials play a critical role in translating scientific discoveries into approved treatments, yet the majority of cancer trials fail to progress through all phases of development to become a therapeutic use. Understanding the factors that contribute to trial success or failure is essential for improving study design, resource allocation, and patient outcomes.

Through exploratory data analysis and data visualization using publicly available clinical trials data, this project seeks to provide insight into what differentiates successful cancer clinical trials from those that end in termination. These findings can inform future trial design and highlight structural advantages or challenges within oncology research that contribute to high attrition rates across clinical phases.
